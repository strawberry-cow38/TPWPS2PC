# TPWPS2PC progress / AI handoff

Updated: 2026-09-23. Roadmap: [plan.md](plan.md).

## Current milestone and next action

M0 includes the completion plan, handoff ledger, and tested ride-availability patch. Publishing uses normal fast-forward pushes from the isolated branch.
Next: M1, a separate audit-runner module with honest known-red classification, followed by a real rendered smoke capture. Keep off the active viewer/placement/particle files.

## Coordination / branch state

* Work is isolated on `astraclaw/ride-eligibility`, not in another agent's live checkout.
* Fetched upstream through `0db3678`, including the latest gate/lights changes, and rebased the eligibility/plan commits. The initial tested patch was `326279e` (first rebased as `4889ea1`); use Git history for the current rebased identity. No force push and no discarded upstream changes.
* Inspected the upstream diff specifically for `ParkSimAudit/Program.cs` and `ParkVisitors.cs`: neither changed between the old `0862aa8` baseline and fetched `f9d1035`. The larger audit additions mentioned in chat were already in `0862aa8` and remain intact.
* Cow tools is actively working in the viewer/placement/particle area. The initial particle snapshot from the sweep is stale: upstream now includes `ParticleTemplate.cs`, consumer-backed findings, and revised emission behavior. Review current source, not that old gap list.
* Initial push failed because this shell had no default HTTPS credential helper. Existing configured GitHub CLI authentication is used via its credential helper; no credential values are read or printed.
* The separate local shared-main checkout still contains the original unpublished eligibility commit; do not reset it or sweep its files into another commit. Remote integration is performed from the isolated branch.

## Completed: closed/broken ride eligibility

Changes in `4889ea1`:
* `core/TPW.PS2.Data/ParkVisitors.cs`: `Takes` requires both declared closed/broken flags to be zero; absent optional flags remain safe through `ParkRide.Get`.
* `tools/TPW.PS2.ParkSimAudit/VisitorAvailabilityChecks.cs`: isolated disc-backed regression fixtures, with no simulated script ticks changing the flags under test.
* `tools/TPW.PS2.ParkSimAudit/Program.cs`: invokes the checks using a real ride fixture without polluting the long-running park scenario.

Evidence before rebase:
* Unfixed core reproduced **15 availability failures** in JUNGLE, HALLOW and SPACE.
* Fixed core passed **30 availability checks in each of JUNGLE, FANTASY, HALLOW and SPACE**: destination filtering, unchanged plans on rejection, arrival-time closure/breakage, reopening/repair, and absent optional flags.
* Full JUNGLE/FANTASY ParkSimAudit passed.
* Full HALLOW/SPACE each retained exactly one pre-existing, separately reproduced baseline failure: Thrill Grill and Moon Buggies respectively. No assertions were weakened.
* Release audit build succeeded. Existing nullable-annotation warnings are not new failures.

Portable reproduction (substitute the owner's existing disc path; do not copy/extract it):

```sh
dotnet build tools/TPW.PS2.ParkSimAudit -c Release
for world in JUNGLE FANTASY HALLOW SPACE; do
  dotnet tools/TPW.PS2.ParkSimAudit/bin/Release/net8.0/TPW.PS2.ParkSimAudit.dll "$DISC" "$world"
done
```

## Known reds / boundaries — preserve evidence

* HALLOW / Thrill Grill: requests an animation slot absent from the relevant disc animation data. Existing audit intentionally reports failure; do not add a fictitious record or weaken the test.
* SPACE / Moon Buggies: lacks the relevant park-space fittings used by the walking path. Existing audit intentionally reports failure; do not fabricate fittings.
* Track-service non-boarding is a separate capability gap, not evidence that every such ride should be made eligible or forced to board.
* The original format inventory is coverage bookkeeping, not proof that every byte or live consumer is complete. READ/CANDIDATE/UNKNOWN distinctions remain important.

## Validation still to do

* Integrated gates rerun on `4889ea1` over upstream `f9d1035`: all 120 availability checks passed; full JUNGLE/FANTASY passed; HALLOW/SPACE each retained only the same single known baseline failure.
* Actual rendered/manual verification is not yet performed for this milestone. No screenshot is being claimed as visually checked.
* No claim of full-game completion, all-world green status, or platform coverage beyond tests actually recorded here.

## Interruption notes

An earlier task ended on a model connection error after worktree creation but before TPW source edits. Astraclaw's model-request retry policy was subsequently fixed and tested; work resumed through an owner-authorized startup job. This project ledger, not the bot's private runtime files, is the intended successor handoff.
